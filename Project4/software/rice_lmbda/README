Modified version of the Rice 2008 model. The overall model is as presented in
the original publication, but the state variable SL has been replaced by lambda to
facilitate coupling to other models. 
The two-component passive force used in the Rice 2008 model is replaced by a 
single Fung-style exponential, which is fairly straight-forward to replace by alternative moels
such as the Holzapfel-Ogden model.
